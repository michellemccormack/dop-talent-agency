# Dopple Talent Agency MVP

Interactive AI Doppelgänger demo with personas, prompts, and video responses.

---

## 📂 Project Structure

- `index.html` — Main UI for the DOP demo
- `personas/`
  - `personas.json` — Persona configuration file (controls name, video, prompts, etc.)
  - Other persona folders (e.g. `/sasha/`) store videos, metadata, etc.

---

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Personas

- Each persona is defined inside `personas/` with a folder containing assets.
- The master list is managed in `personas/personas.json`.

Example:

```json
{
  "activePersona": "sasha",
  "switcher": false,
  "personas": [
    {
      "id": "sasha",
      "name": "Sasha",
      "video": "personas/sasha/intro.mp4",
      "prompts": [
        "What do you like to do for fun?",
        "Where are you from?",
        "What's your favorite way to relax?"
      ]
    }
  ]
}

## 📝 Notes

- Videos do **not autoplay or loop** — user engagement (prompt/mic) always starts interaction.
- `ui.switcher: false` → Persona dropdown hidden (manual mode).
- `ui.switcher: true` → Persona dropdown visible (shows “Sasha ▼” in header).
- When adding a new persona, update `personas/personas.json`.

---

## 📌 Current Phase
- ✅ Phase 1 (baseline UI complete)
- ✅ Phase 2 / Task 20 (multi-prompt + persona support added)
- Next: Task 21 (persona switcher toggle) → optional until multiple DOPs exist
## Persona Switching

- By default, if there is **only one persona** in `personas.json`, no dropdown will appear in the header.
- Once you add a **second persona**, a dropdown will **automatically appear**, allowing you to switch between them.
- If you want the dropdown to be visible even with a single persona (e.g., “Sasha ▼”), you would need to update the HTML/JS to always render it. Current setup hides it until multiple personas exist.
